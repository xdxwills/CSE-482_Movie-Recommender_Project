# CSE-482_Movie-Recommender_Project

This entire project has been developed by Daniel Wills (willsda1).

Instructions to utilize each of the Python programs in this repository are outlined in the final report that was submitted to D2L. This is because each of these Python scripts require files that are too large to be included within this repository and need to be downloaded from other websites.

This repository exists so each of the individual source code files can be easily viewed and downloaded for usage.
